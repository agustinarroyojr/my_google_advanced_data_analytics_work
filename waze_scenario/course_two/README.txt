Project goal: 

Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. 
Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. 
This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user 
retention, and grow Waze’s business.

Background: 

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want 
to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make 
each drive better and safer. 

Scenario: 

Your team is in the early stages of their user churn project. Your project proposal has been 
approved and your team has been given access to Waze’s user data. To get clear insights, the data 
must first be inspected, organized, and prepared for analysis. 

Course 2 tasks:

    Import data

    Create a dataframe 

    Inspect data 

    Identify outliers

    Create a data visualization

    Share an executive summary with the Waze data team
